# Exploration of worldnews posts using NLP methods

1. Exploratory Analysis:
> - how many articles? per year, month, etc.
> - distribution of upvote scores?
> - how do upvotes relate to publish date?
> - how to upvotes relate to title length?
> - common words in popular/unpopular titles?

2. Topic Modeling
> - analysis of up votes by topic genre
> - learn the topics that describe the dataset
> - do some topics get (significantly) more upvotes than others?

3. Sentiment Analysis
> - how does sentiment affect upvotes?
> - do certain topics have more positive/negative sentiment?

4. Future to-do's:
> - text generation. fine-tune a transformer text model (BERT, GPT-#) on titles with high upvotes. purpose: help authors generate titles that get good engagement, are popular
> - named entity recognition. pick out proper nouns (countries) and see how their presence affects up votes. and how they trend over time
> - predict number of upvotes based on topics, sentiment, date, time, etc
